# EneBot
Personal discord bots mostly made as training. You can run it by yourself. Clone the repo and create a new directory `config`, inside you need to create three files : 
- `token.key` : containing your bot token (found on discord's developper portal)
- `owner_id.key` : not required but necessary for some admin commands, containing your own discord id (with developper mode on right click on your username and then `copy id`)
- `ytbToken.key` : not required but necessary for music commands, containing your youtube's token
